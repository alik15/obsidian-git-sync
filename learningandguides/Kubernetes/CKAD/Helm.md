When we have a big app with a lot of yaml files, updating and maintaing them is very difficult thus we need a "package manager" for it
this package is called HELM
it can also be thought of as an installer

Helm actions
 `helm install`
 
 adds all necessary objects, in a values.yaml file we can edit any settings we want
 
 
 `helm upgrade` 
 helm knows what objects to upgrade 
 `helm rollback` 
 helm knows what deployments to rollback
 `helm uninstall`
