Types of DNS servers 

### 1.1 DNS Recursive Resolver 
### 1.2 Root Name Server 
### 1.3 Top Level Domain 
### 1.4 Authoritative Name Server



### 2 DNS caching 
DNS is cached on various servers down the lane which is done so that the next time you try to reach a website, the fetch time is quicker
However this also introduces a problem; when a websites ip address changes, it is still assosiated in your local DNS cache with its original ip address and is trying to go to that ip address and thus is never resolved [^1]
