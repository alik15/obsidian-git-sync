KillerCoda for simple CKAD and CKA exercises(very close to actual exam)

Really really good for getting fast at the commands and has some things that killer coda misses.

There isn't an equivalent version for CKA that is as useful.

Focus more on the kodekloud labs and mock exams and just go over udemy’s syllabus once for CKAD. For CKA if you have taken CKA before, you can skip the parts that were in CKAD

CKAD: focuses more on the application part of kubernetes  which means that objects will be will be more on objects related to applications for example

1. Pods
    
2. Deployments
    
3. Jobs
    
4. Cronjobs
    
5. ingress
    

  

Most of the exam is deploying these objects with given specifications. Make sure you know how to check if an object creation is successful or not.

  

Note: there are other parts of the exam, this is just the focus 

  
  

CKA: this focuses more on the administrative part of Kubernetes. Which means you will also have to focus on parts like roles, service accounts including things you learning in CKAD

  
  
  

General exam tips

  

Imperative commands arent just helpful, they are necessary for the exam. If there is an imperative command you can use to sovlve a problem, you need to use it. 

  

Identify what the general questions for each object would be.

For example:

-  you could be asked to create an object that runs a single command
    
-   
    

Get fast at the commands

Make sure you know what the yaml for objects looks like

For example if asked to add a container port to the yaml, do not go to the documentation page, you should be able to do it yourself

  

You only need to go to the documentation for 

1. Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims 
    
2. Network Policies
    

  

And you need the documentation for these since you cant create these resources using the command line.

  
  

You will be ready for the exam once:

1. You can do all the killercoda exercises and github exercises without looking at
